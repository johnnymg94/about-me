        Yep, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this
        situation. I was born on April 8th 1994 in town called Liverpool. I grew
        up in an area called Bootle and if you’ve never been then that’s
        defiantly something you should stick too. By age 11 I moved to a place
        called Netherton and if you haven’t been there either then keep
        continuing with your sensible life decisions. Speaking of sensible life
        decisions I haven’t made many. When I was 6 I was sat down by my friends
        in the school canteen and told to pick a football team; Liverpool or
        Everton. I didn’t know much about them both so I just chose Everton.
        I’ve thought about that moment a lot through the years. I inherited the
        bad decision gene from my parents. In total I have a family of 4
        brothers and 3 sisters so Christmas is an expensive time of year and is
        probably why I don’t won’t to add children of my own anytime soon. I
        graduated from Edge Hill University in 2015 with a degree in Film &
        Television which, at the time, I though was something of some use. Since
        then I’ve went on to have a career in directing, photography, graphic
        design, motion graphics, creative management, event producing and a
        visual technician all the while being colour blind. I have a list of
        things I’d like to learn and pursue in my life such as creative
        directing, stage design, creating visual exhibitions and of course
        coding. I’m just trying to be a creative person, my name is Earl… I mean
        Johnny.

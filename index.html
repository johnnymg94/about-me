          <p>Yep, that’s me. You’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.</p>
          <p>
            I was born on April 8th 1994 in town called Liverpool. I grew up in an area called Bootle and if you’ve never
            been then that’s defiantly something you should stick too. By age 11 I moved to a place called Netherton and if
            you haven’t been there either then keep continuing with your sensible life decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking of sensible life decisions I haven’t made many. When I was 6 I was sat down by my friends in the school
            canteen and told to pick a football team; Liverpool or Everton. I didn’t know much about them both so I just
            chose Everton. I’ve thought about that moment a lot through the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I inherited the bad decision gene from my parents. In total I have a family of 4 brothers and 3 sisters so
            Christmas is an expensive time of year and is probably why I don’t won’t to add children of my own anytime soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Edge Hill University in 2015 with a degree in Film & Television which, at the time, I though was
            something of some use. Since then I’ve went on to have a career in directing, photography, graphic design, motion
            graphics, creative management, event producing and a visual technician all the while being colour blind.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have a list of things I’d like to learn and pursue in my life such as creative directing, stage design,
            creating visual exhibitions and of course coding. I’m just trying to be a creative person, my name is Earl… I
            mean Johnny.
